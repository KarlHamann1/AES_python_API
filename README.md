# Arduino Side-Channel Data Acquisition

This project demonstrates how to capture side-channel data, such as power traces or LED brightness changes, from an Arduino performing AES encryption. It uses a photodiode connected to a Picoscope for capturing the data and a Python-based interface for communication and control.

---

## **Features**
- Arduino-based AES encryption.
- Data acquisition using a Picoscope triggered by the Arduino's hardware pin.
- Python interface for controlling the Arduino and capturing data.
- Automatic saving of captured traces in `.npy` format for efficient storage.
- Metadata (e.g., timestamps, sampling rates) included for easier post-processing.
- Visualization of captured traces with Matplotlib.

### **Hardware**
- **Arduino Uno** with AES encryption firmware.
- **Photodiode** connected to a **transimpedance amplifier (TIA)**.
- **Picoscope** (e.g., Picoscope 5000 series).
- Computer with USB connections for Arduino and Picoscope.

### **Software**
- Python 3.8+ with the following libraries:
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `picosdk`
- Arduino IDE for uploading the firmware.

## **Setup Instructions**

### **1. Arduino Setup**
1. Upload the `AES_Encipher.ino` firmware to the Arduino Uno.
2. Ensure the Arduino is connected to the computer via USB.
3. Configure a digital pin (e.g., A0) to output a trigger signal during encryption.

### **2. Picoscope Setup**
1. Connect the photodiode output to the Picoscope input (Channel A).
2. Connect the Arduino trigger pin to the Picoscopeâ€™s external trigger input (EXT).
3. Ensure the Picoscope is connected to the computer via USB.

### **3. Python Environment**
1. Install Python 3.8+.
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy matplotlib picosdk

### **4. Run the Project**
- python main.py

View and analyze the saved traces using the visualization script:

- python visualize.py data/<filename>.npy
